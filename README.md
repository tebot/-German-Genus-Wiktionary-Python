# -German-Genus-Wiktionary-Python

I wrote a python function that search for the genus (Neutral/Female/Male) of a word in the German language. 
With this function you can for example let your bot know which article (der/die/das) it need to put before a word in German. This makes the bot look more human in some cases.
I tested it only in German because I only know German and English, but it could also be that it work with French, Spanish and maybe some other languages. (I tested it with a few French words and it worked. However I am not so sure about it because I can't really speak French). If you tried it in other languages please let me know the results.
